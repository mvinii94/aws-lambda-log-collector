# AWS Lambda Log Collector

If you usually find yourself trying to debug AWS Lambda Functions and getting lost when trying to search for logs,
this CLI is meant for you.

Imagine your Lambda Function had an invocation error spike during last night. Today after arriving at your company you 
need to troubleshoot that error spike. You usually need to open CloudWatch Logs console and start to scroll infinitely
through the Log Streams, even worse if the Lambda Function has millions of invocations daily.

This CLI will help you to gather all the useful CloudWatch Logs from a Lambda Function, with a single command while
you can go for your morning coffee.

**Why?**

Because you can search for a subset of the these logs providing a start and end time, and even better you can also
provide a [CloudWatch Logs Filter Pattern]((https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/FilterAndPatternSyntax.html)). 
Making it easier to find what you are looking for!
